# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions in Go

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2023, written in Go.

## Workflow

1. Each day's problem is solved in a separate Go file, named according to the day. For example, the solution for day 1 is in `day1.go`.

2. Unit tests for each day's problem are in a corresponding `_test.go` file. For example, tests for `day1.go` are in `day1_test.go`.

3. To run the solution for a specific day, use the `go run day<number>.go <test_filepath>` command. For example, to run the solution for day 1, use the `go run day1.go input.txt` command.

4. To run the tests for a specific day, use the `go test` command.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the day's solution you want to run.
3. Run the solution or tests as described above.

# AdventOfCode

This repository hosts the completed tasks for Advent Of Code.

Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed computer programming challenges that follow an Advent calendar. It has been running since 2015. The programming puzzles cover a variety of skill sets and skill levels and can be solved using any programming language. It is an excellent way to hone current skills and learn new programming languages

Each year, I will learn new languages and complete tasks using those languages.
